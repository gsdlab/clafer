			This option controls whether or not code is included in SQLite to enable it to operate safely in a multithreaded environment. The default is SQLITE_THREADSAFE=1 which is safe for use in a multithreaded environment. When compiled with SQLITE_THREADSAFE=0 all mutexing code is omitted and it is unsafe to use SQLite in a multithreaded program. When compiled with SQLITE_THREADSAFE=2, SQLite can be used in a multithreaded program so long as no two threads attempt to use the same database connection at the same time.
			To put it another way, SQLITE_THREADSAFE=1 sets the default threading mode to Serialized. SQLITE_THREADSAFE=2 sets the default threading mode to Multi-threaded. And SQLITE_THREADSAFE=0 sets the threading mode to Single-threaded.
			The value of SQLITE_THREADSAFE can be determined at run-time using the sqlite3_threadsafe() interface.
			When SQLite has been compiled with SQLITE_THREADSAFE=1 or SQLITE_THREADSAFE=2 then the threading mode can be altered at run-time using the sqlite3_config() interface together with one of these verbs:
				SQLITE_CONFIG_SINGLETHREAD
				SQLITE_CONFIG_MULTITHREAD
				SQLITE_CONFIG_SERIALIZED
			The SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX and SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX flags to sqlite3_open_v2() can also be used to adjust the threading mode of individual database connections at run-time.
			Note that when SQLite is compiled with SQLITE_THREADSAFE=0, the code to make SQLite threadsafe is omitted from the build. When this occurs, it is impossible to change the threading mode at start-time or run-time.
			See the threading mode documentation for additional information on aspects of using SQLite in a multithreaded environment.

			2	Use memory by default but allow the PRAGMA temp_store command to override
